# Simple Markup Parser

This is the simplest markup parser I could come up with for my own use.  It's about 75 lines of dirt-simple Scheme, and could be made smaller.  It works on a tiny subset of Markdown defined strictly for its utility in fiction and other long-form writing.  In other words, a plain text file with exactly one header and paragraphs separated by blank lines.  It emits s-expressions that can be easily converted into various output formats.  See the enclosed file OUTPUT for the output from parsing this file.

It doesn't do images, bold or italic text, tables, bulleted lists, or even hyperlinks.  It really is just for old-school long-form writing with no distractions.

The parser makes the following assumptions: (1) that each major unit of text will have a single chapter heading, denoted by a line starting with `#', (2) followed by paragraphs of text.  Paragraphs are separated by empty lines.

The tags it emits are as follows: 'C' marks a chapter, 'H' a header, 'S' a sentence or sentence fragment (meaning no special formatting), and 'Q' marks a quotation.  In printed fiction, sometimes quotations are formatted differently.

Finally, note that it's written using scsh (The Scheme Shell), but the only non-R5RS bits are in the TEST-THE-PARSER procedure at the end.
