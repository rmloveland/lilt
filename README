# Lilt, a Simple Markup Parser

Lilt: "To sing in a light manner."

This is the simplest markup parser that could possibly work (for me).  It's about 75 lines of Scheme, and could be made smaller.  It works on a tiny subset of Markdown: a plain text file with exactly one header and paragraphs separated by blank lines.  It emits s-expressions that can be converted into output formats such as HTML.  See the enclosed file OUTPUT for the output from parsing this file.

It doesn't do images, bold or italic text, tables, bulleted lists, or even hyperlinks.  It really is very simple.

The parser makes the following assumptions: first, that each file will have a single title or heading, denoted by a line starting with '#'; second, that the heading will be followed by a blank line, followed by paragraphs of text.  Finally, paragraphs are separated by empty lines, and sentences are split by periods.

The tags it emits are as follows: 'C' marks a chapter, 'H' a header, 'P' a whole paragraph, 'S' a sentence, and 'Q' a quotation (so that you can apply formatting such as italics if you wish).
