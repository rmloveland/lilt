      (s "  It works on a tiny subset of Markdown: a plain text file with exactly one header and paragraphs separated by blank lines.")
      (s "  It emits s-expressions that can be converted into output formats such as HTML.")

   (p (s "It doesn't do images, bold or italic text, tables, bulleted lists, or even hyperlinks.")
      (s "  It really is very simple."))
   (p (s "The parser makes the following assumptions: first, that each file will have a single title or heading, denoted by a line starting with '#'; second, that the heading will be followed by a blank line, followed by paragraphs of text.")
      (s "  Finally, paragraphs are separated by empty lines, and sentences are split by periods."))
   (p (s "The tags it emits are as follows: 'C' marks a chapter, 'H' a header, 'P' a whole paragraph, 'S' a sentence, and 'Q' a quotation (so that you can apply formatting such as italics if you wish)."))
