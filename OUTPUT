(C (H " Lilt, a Simple Markup Parser")
   (P (Q "\"To sing in a light manner.\""))
   (P (S "This is the simplest markup parser I could come up with for my own use.")
      (S "  It's about 75 lines of dirt-simple Scheme, and could be made smaller.")
      (S "  It works on a tiny subset of Markdown defined strictly for its utility in long-form fiction writing: a plain text file with exactly one header and paragraphs separated by blank lines.")
      (S "  It emits s-expressions that can be easily converted into various output formats such as HTML.")
      (S "  See the enclosed file OUTPUT for the output from parsing this file."))
   (P (S "It doesn't do images, bold or italic text, tables, bulleted lists, or even hyperlinks.")
      (S "  It really is just for old-school fiction writing with no distractions."))
   (P (S "The parser makes the following assumptions: (1) that each major unit of text will have a single title or chapter heading, denoted by a line starting with `#', (2) followed by a blank line, (3) followed by paragraphs of text.")
      (S "  Paragraphs are separated by empty lines."))
   (P (S "The tags it emits are as follows: 'C' marks a chapter, 'H' a header, 'P' a whole paragraph, 'S' a sentence or sentence fragment (meaning no special formatting is needed), and 'Q' a quotation (so that you can apply formatting if you wish).")
      (S "  In printed fiction, sometimes quotations are formatted differently, for example."))
   (P (S "Finally, note that it's written using scsh (The Scheme Shell), but the only non-R5RS bits are in the TEST-THE-PARSER procedure at the end.")))
