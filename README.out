((H " Simple Markup Parser")
 (P (S "This parser works on a tiny subset of Markdown, defined strictly for its utility in fiction and long-form nonfiction writing.")
    (S "  My assumption is that the file will have a single heading, denoted by a line starting with `#' at the top of the file (like this one), followed by paragraphs of text."))
 (P (S "The paragraphs are defined by the single empty line that separates them."))
 (P (S "Finally, we have support for quotation marks, as used in dialogue between characters, e.")
    (S "g.")
    (Q "\"He opened the window and saw a girl in the market across the street.\""))
 (P (S "See the file README.") (S "out for the output from parsing this file."))
 (P (S "The markup from the parser is as follows: 'H' is for headers, 'S' is for sentence (regular) formatting, and 'Q' is for quotations.")
    (S "  In printed fiction, sometimes quotations are formatted differently.")))
